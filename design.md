# Redis Implementation Design Document

## Overview

This document outlines the architecture for a Redis server implementation broken down into three main components: Server, Protocol, and Store. The design follows a clean separation of concerns, allowing for modular development, testing, and extension.

## System Components

### 1. Server

The Server component acts as the entry point and handles TCP connections with clients.

**Responsibilities:**

- Bind to TCP port 6379 (default Redis port)
- Accept and manage client connections
- Route incoming data to the Protocol layer for parsing
- Send responses back to clients
- Handle connection lifecycle (establishment, maintenance, termination)
- Manage concurrency with multiple client connections

**Implementation Considerations:**

- Use Go's net package for TCP socket handling
- Implement concurrency using goroutines for each client connection
- Handle graceful shutdown and error scenarios
- Maintain connection state

### 2. Protocol

The Protocol component handles serialization and deserialization of the Redis Serialization Protocol (RESP).

**Responsibilities:**

- Parse incoming RESP data into Query objects
- Serialize Result objects into RESP format for responses
- Handle different RESP data types (Simple Strings, Errors, Integers, Bulk Strings, Arrays)
- Validate protocol compliance

**Key Structures:**

```
Query {
    Command: string
    Args: []interface{}
    // Metadata as needed
}

Result {
    Type: ResultType (SimpleString, Error, Integer, BulkString, Array)
    Value: interface{}
    // Error information if applicable
}
```

**Implementation Considerations:**

- Create parsers for each RESP data type
- Implement robust error handling for malformed protocol messages
- Optimize for efficient parsing and serialization

### 3. Command Layer

The Command Layer acts as an intermediary between the Protocol and Store components.

**Responsibilities:**

- Interpret Query objects into specific Redis commands
- Route commands to appropriate Store methods
- Convert Store responses into Result objects
- Handle command-specific validation and error cases

**Implementation Considerations:**

- Implement a command registry for extensibility
- Support command pipelining
- Provide consistent error handling across commands

### 4. Store

The Store component manages data structures and persistence.

**Responsibilities:**

- Maintain in-memory data structures for different Redis data types
- Execute operations on data (get, set, delete, etc.)
- Manage key expiration (TTL)
- Handle persistence (RDB snapshots and/or AOF logs)
- Recover data on restart

**Data Types:**

- Strings
- Lists
- Sets
- Hashes
- Sorted Sets
- Geospatial indexes (optional)
- Bitmaps (optional)
- HyperLogLogs (optional)

**Implementation Considerations:**

- Efficient data structure implementation
- Concurrency control for data access
- Memory management
- Configurable persistence strategies

## Data Flow

1. Client sends a command over TCP connection
2. Server receives raw data and passes it to Protocol
3. Protocol parses raw data into a Query object
4. Query is passed to Command Layer
5. Command Layer interprets the query and calls appropriate Store methods
6. Store processes the command and returns data/status
7. Command Layer converts the result into a Result object
8. Protocol serializes the Result into RESP format
9. Server sends the serialized response back to the client

## Error Handling

- Protocol errors: Malformed RESP data
- Command errors: Invalid commands or arguments
- Execution errors: Issues during command execution
- System errors: Memory, disk, or network problems

All errors should be propagated back to the client in appropriate RESP error format.

## Persistence Strategies

1. **RDB Snapshots**:
   - Periodic point-in-time snapshots of the dataset
   - Configurable snapshot frequency
   - Background saving process

2. **Append-Only File (AOF)**:
   - Log every write operation
   - Configurable fsync policy (always, every second, OS)
   - Background AOF rewriting for size optimization

## Future Extensions

- Replication
- Clustering
- Pub/Sub functionality
- Lua scripting
- Transactions (MULTI/EXEC)
- Custom commands

## Implementation Phases

1. **Phase 1**: Basic TCP server with PING command
2. **Phase 2**: RESP protocol implementation
3. **Phase 3**: Basic string operations (GET, SET)
4. **Phase 4**: More data types (Lists, Sets, etc.)
5. **Phase 5**: Expiration (TTL)
6. **Phase 6**: Persistence
7. **Phase 7**: Advanced features

## Testing Strategy

- Unit tests for each component
- Integration tests for component interactions
- End-to-end tests using Redis clients
- Benchmark tests for performance evaluation
- Stress tests for stability under load
